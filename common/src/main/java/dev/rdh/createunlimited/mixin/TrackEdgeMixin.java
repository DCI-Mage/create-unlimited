/**
 * This mixin is used to modify the {@link TrackEdge#canTravelTo(TrackEdge)} method to allow for "extended driving". Setting the value below 0.1 causes some weird issues where the train turns around at forks, hence the 0.1 minimum.
 * <p>
 * Theoretically, some turns won't work as their connection value is less than 0.1, but in my tests, even 90Â° straight-up turns worked "fine".
 * <p>
 * If you manage to make a legitimate track that doesn't work with this, please let me know.
 * @see <a href="https://github/rhysdh540/create-unlimited/issues/1">yell at me here</a>
